# Exercise 2.13 Average of positive numbers

Write a program that asks the user for input until the user inputs 0.
After this, the program prints the average of the positive numbers (numbers that are greater than zero).

If no positive number is inputted, the program prints "Cannot calculate the average"

Below a few examples of the programs output
